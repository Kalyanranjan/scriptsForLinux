# scriptsForLinux
This is the repository for my bash scripts I use on my linux machine - to make my life easier. Although these script are mostly my work, I do not claim that all components of this collection is entirely mine. I will cite any sources I used in the scripts. 

_PS- These scripts might not be compatible to other machines. Thus, exercise caution in using them in your machines._
